The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s.

      "The Berlin Wall was a physical barrier that divided the city of Berlin, Germany from 1961 to 1989. It was built by the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also known as East Germany, in an effort to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the democratic West Germany. The wall was a symbol of the Cold War and the ideological divide between communism and capitalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, and it consisted of a concrete wall, barbed wire, and guard towers. The wall stretched for 96 miles, dividing the city of Berlin into two separate parts. The eastern side, controlled by the GDR, became known as East Berlin, while the western side, controlled by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), became known as West Berlin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Berlin Wall was heavily guarded and fortified, making it nearly impossible for East Germans to escape to the West. Those who attempted to cross the wall were met with deadly force from border guards. It is estimated that over 100 people were killed while trying to cross the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wall became a symbol of the Iron Curtain, the boundary between communist and non-communist countries in Europe. It also represented the suppression of human rights and the lack of freedom under communist rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the late 1980s, with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the pressure to tear down the wall grew. On November 9, 1989, the East German government announced that citizens could freely cross the border. This led to a joyous celebration as people from both sides of the wall came together and began to dismantle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of German reunification. Today, parts of the wall still stand as a reminder of the division and oppression that once existed in Berlin. The Berlin Wall serves as a powerful symbol of the human desire for freedom and the triumph of democracy over communism.\n"
